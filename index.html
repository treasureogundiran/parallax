        “Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the
        gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance,
        and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past
        into the unknown future.”

        “The world, when you look at it, it just can't be random. I mean, it's
        so different than the vast emptiness that is everything else, and even
        all the other planets we've seen, at least in our solar system, none of
        them even remotely resemble the precious life-giving nature of our own
        planet.”
